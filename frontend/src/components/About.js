        <p>
          I'm Armon Barakchi â€” a software engineer with a background in electrical engineering.
          I enjoy building performant, well-structured systems in C++ and Python.
          My passion lies in solving complex problems at the intersection of logic and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of engineering, I love working on personal projects, exploring new technologies,
          and learning through writing. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities in software development.
